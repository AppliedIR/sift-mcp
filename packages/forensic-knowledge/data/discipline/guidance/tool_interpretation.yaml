tools:
  check_file:
    tool: "windows-triage-mcp: check_file"
    score_interpretation:
      EXPECTED: "File matches known Windows baseline. Normal."
      UNKNOWN: "File NOT in baseline database. This is NEUTRAL — it means not-in-database, not suspicious. Custom software, user files, and enterprise tools will all be UNKNOWN."
      RENAMED: "Filename matches a known system file but path or hash differs. Investigate further."
    common_false_positives:
      - "Enterprise software agents (AV, management tools) flagged as UNKNOWN"
      - "Windows updates changing file hashes before baseline is updated"
      - "Legitimate portable tools in user directories"
    caveats:
      - "Baseline covers default Windows installations only"
      - "Custom enterprise software will appear as UNKNOWN"
      - "A file being EXPECTED does not rule out compromise (legitimate file can be abused)"
  check_process_tree:
    tool: "windows-triage-mcp: check_process_tree"
    score_interpretation:
      EXPECTED: "Parent-child relationship matches known baseline."
      UNEXPECTED: "Unusual parent-child relationship. May indicate process injection, living-off-the-land, or unusual execution."
    common_false_positives:
      - "Software installers spawning unusual child processes"
      - "Task scheduler creating atypical process trees"
      - "Debugging tools with unusual parent processes"
    caveats:
      - "Process tree at time of collection, not runtime"
      - "Parent PID reuse can create misleading relationships"
  search:
    tool: "forensic-rag-mcp: search"
    score_interpretation:
      "0.85+": "Excellent match — high confidence the result is directly relevant"
      "0.75-0.84": "Good match — relevant but review context carefully"
      "0.65-0.74": "Fair match — may be tangential, verify applicability"
      "<0.65": "Weak match — likely not relevant to your query"
    caveats:
      - "Semantic search returns related content, not exact matches"
      - "A high score indicates relevance, not confirmation of a hypothesis"
      - "Results reflect the knowledge base content, not ground truth"
  search_threat_intel:
    tool: "opencti-mcp: search_threat_intel"
    caveats:
      - "Threat intelligence reflects KNOWN threats, not ALL threats"
      - "Confidence scores reflect source reliability, not certainty of match"
      - "Absence from threat intel does not mean clean"
      - "IOC matching is necessary but not sufficient for attribution"
