anti_patterns:
  - name: "premature_attribution"
    description: "Attributing to a threat actor based on a single indicator (e.g., one matching hash). Attribution requires multiple TTPs, infrastructure, and temporal consistency."
    severity: "critical"
    how_to_avoid: "Require at least 3 independent indicators from different categories before naming a threat actor. Check for false flag techniques. Present alternative attributions. Always stage as DRAFT with type=attribution for examiner review."
  - name: "confirmation_bias"
    description: "Seeking evidence that confirms an early hypothesis while ignoring contradictory evidence. Actively look for evidence that disproves your theory."
    severity: "critical"
    how_to_avoid: "After forming a hypothesis, explicitly search for contradicting evidence before corroborating evidence. Run tool queries designed to disprove your theory. Document both supporting and contradicting evidence in the finding."
  - name: "cascade_error"
    description: "Building conclusions on top of unverified findings. Each layer of inference should be independently supported."
    severity: "high"
    how_to_avoid: "Never reference a DRAFT finding as established fact. Each finding must stand on its own evidence. If finding B depends on finding A, wait for A to be APPROVED before staging B, or explicitly note the dependency."
  - name: "tool_trust"
    description: "Treating tool output as ground truth. Tools have false positives and false negatives. Always corroborate."
    severity: "high"
    how_to_avoid: "Read caveats and field notes in tool responses. Cross-check with a second tool or source. Be especially skeptical of regex-based detections, signature matches, and YARA rules — they can match benign files."
  - name: "temporal_assumption"
    description: "Assuming event ordering from file timestamps alone. Timestamps can be manipulated. Corroborate with multiple timeline sources."
    severity: "high"
    how_to_avoid: "Compare timestamps from filesystem metadata, event logs, network captures, and application logs. Check for timestamp gaps or impossible sequences. Note the time source and timezone for each artifact."
  - name: "scope_creep_without_evidence"
    description: "Expanding investigation scope based on speculation rather than evidence. New investigative directions should be justified."
    severity: "medium"
    how_to_avoid: "Before investigating a new system or hypothesis, cite the specific evidence that justifies the expansion. Record a TODO with the justification. Get examiner approval for major scope changes."
