description: "Investigate event log clearing, suspicious gaps, and anti-forensic activity targeting log integrity"
mitre: ["T1070.001", "T1070"]
sources:
  - "SANS FOR508 — Windows Enterprise Incident Response"
  - "MITRE ATT&CK T1070.001 — Clear Windows Event Logs"
  - "MITRE ATT&CK T1070 — Indicator Removal"
triggers:
  - "Event ID 1102 detected (Security log cleared)"
  - "Event ID 104 detected (System log cleared)"
  - "Gaps in event log sequence numbers"
  - "Missing expected log entries for known activity period"
phases:
  - phase: "Identify"
    steps:
      - "Parse event logs with Hayabusa (via sift-mcp or wintools-mcp) for log clearing events — Event IDs 1102, 104"
      - "Check for time gaps in event sequence numbers across all log channels"
      - "Compare expected log volume against actual for the investigation timeframe"
  - phase: "Timeline"
    steps:
      - "Establish exactly when logs were cleared using the clearing event timestamps"
      - "Determine what timeframe is now missing or incomplete"
      - "Check if clearing coincides with other suspicious activity"
  - phase: "Alternative Sources"
    steps:
      - "Check USN Journal for file system activity during the gap using MFTECmd (via sift-mcp or wintools-mcp)"
      - "Check Sysmon logs which are stored in a separate event log channel"
      - "Check PowerShell transcripts and PSReadLine history for command activity"
      - "Check network logs and PCAP for activity during the gap period"
  - phase: "Attribution"
    steps:
      - "Determine which account cleared the logs from Event ID 1102 subject fields"
      - "Check what that account did before and after clearing — logon events, process execution"
      - "Verify account against baseline (windows-triage: check_file)"
  - phase: "Record"
    steps:
      - "Document the gap, alternative sources consulted, and evidence of anti-forensic activity"
      - "HITL checkpoint — evidence destruction may affect legal proceedings and investigation scope"
