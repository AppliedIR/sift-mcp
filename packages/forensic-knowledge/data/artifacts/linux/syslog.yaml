description: "Central system log aggregating messages from kernel, services, and applications"
platform: linux

locations:
  - path: "/var/log/syslog"
    os_versions: ["Debian", "Ubuntu"]
    notes: "Primary system log on Debian-based systems."
  - path: "/var/log/messages"
    os_versions: ["RHEL", "CentOS", "Fedora"]
    notes: "Equivalent file on Red Hat-based systems."

proves:
  - "System events from kernel and services"
  - "Service start/stop events"
  - "Kernel messages (hardware, drivers, security modules)"
  - "Application log messages sent to syslog facility"
  - "Network events (DHCP, DNS resolver, firewall)"

does_not_prove:
  - "Application-specific events not routed to syslog"
  - "Events if syslog daemon was stopped or logs were cleared"
  - "Detailed application behavior (only what applications choose to log)"

timestamps:
  - field: "Syslog timestamp"
    meaning: "When the message was received by syslog daemon"
    common_misinterpretation: "May not include year or timezone in default format. Check rsyslog/syslog-ng configuration."

common_misinterpretations:
  - claim: "Syslog contains everything that happens on the system"
    correction: "Syslog only contains messages explicitly sent to the syslog facility. Many applications use their own log files."
  - claim: "Syslog timestamps are always accurate"
    correction: "Syslog timestamps reflect the receiving daemon's time. If NTP is not configured, times may be inaccurate."
