name: Jump Lists
description: "Windows Jump Lists tracking recently and frequently accessed files per application"
platform: windows

locations:
  - path: "C:\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\AutomaticDestinations"
    os_versions: ["Windows 7+", "Windows 10", "Windows 11"]
    notes: "Automatic Jump Lists maintained by the OS; filenames are AppID.automaticDestinations-ms"
  - path: "C:\\Users\\{username}\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Recent\\CustomDestinations"
    os_versions: ["Windows 7+", "Windows 10", "Windows 11"]
    notes: "Custom Jump Lists maintained by individual applications; filenames are AppID.customDestinations-ms"

proves:
  - "A specific user accessed or opened a file through a specific application"
  - "Application usage by the user (via AppID mapping)"
  - "File path, timestamps, and volume information of accessed files"
  - "Network share paths and remote file access"

does_not_prove:
  - "File content that was viewed or edited"
  - "How long the file was open"
  - "That the file still exists at the recorded path"
  - "That the user intentionally opened the file (some applications auto-populate)"

timestamps:
  - field: "TargetCreated"
    meaning: "Creation timestamp of the target file at the time the Jump List entry was recorded"
    common_misinterpretation: "This is the target file's timestamp, not when the Jump List entry was created"
  - field: "TargetModified"
    meaning: "Modification timestamp of the target file at the time the Jump List entry was recorded"
    common_misinterpretation: "Reflects the file's state when accessed, not the Jump List entry time"
  - field: "TargetAccessed"
    meaning: "Access timestamp of the target file"
    common_misinterpretation: "May be stale if last access time updates are disabled"

common_misinterpretations:
  - claim: "Jump Lists only track files opened by double-clicking"
    correction: "Jump Lists track files opened through the application regardless of method — File > Open, drag-and-drop, command line with file association, and recent file lists."
  - claim: "Clearing recent documents removes all Jump List data"
    correction: "Clearing recent documents from the UI may not fully clear the underlying Jump List files. Residual data may remain in custom destinations or in free space within the OLE compound files."
  - claim: "AppIDs are unique to each application"
    correction: "AppIDs are based on the application path. The same application installed in different locations generates different AppIDs. Known AppID mappings are available in reference databases."
  - claim: "Jump Lists and LNK files contain the same information"
    correction: "Jump Lists contain embedded LNK entries but provide additional context by grouping them per application. The Jump List container itself has metadata not present in standalone LNK files."
