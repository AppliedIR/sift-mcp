category: file_analysis
description: "High-performance record carving tool that extracts forensic features (emails, URLs, credit cards, EXIF data, network packets, Windows artifacts) from disk images, files, and unallocated space"
platform: [windows, linux, macos]
platform_notes: "C++ tool. Pre-installed on SIFT (Linux). Windows builds available. Same flags and output."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Output directory must be specified with -o and must not already exist"
  - "Default scanners may produce very large output — use -e/-x flags to enable/disable specific scanners"
  - "Does not require a mounted file system — works directly on raw data, E01 images, and unallocated space"
  - "Carving results include both allocated and unallocated data — fragments may be incomplete"
  - "Processing large disk images can take hours — use -Y for offset ranges to limit scope"
  - "Feature files contain one finding per line with byte offset — offsets may not map to specific files"

output_notes:
  format: text
  key_fields: [feature_file, offset, feature_value, context]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Output directory (-o) is required and must be a new directory — bulk_extractor refuses to overwrite"
  - "Key output files: email.txt, url.txt, domain.txt, telephone.txt, ccn.txt, exif.txt, winpe.txt"
  - "Use -e scanner_name to enable additional scanners (e.g., -e ntfsusn for USN journal carving)"
  - "Use -x scanner_name to disable scanners (e.g., -x accts to skip credit card scanning)"
  - "Combine with blkls for targeted carving of only unallocated space"
  - "The histogram files (*_histogram.txt) provide frequency analysis of findings"
  - "Use -Y offset to start scanning at a specific byte offset for targeted analysis"
  - "Results can be loaded into bulk_extractor Viewer (BEViewer) for interactive analysis"
  - "Particularly valuable for recovering email addresses, URLs, and network indicators from wiped systems"

quick_start: "bulk_extractor -o output_dir image.dd"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Run bulk_extractor against the disk image to carve forensic records from all areas including unallocated space"
  - "Review all generated feature files — each scanner extracts different data types"
  - "Check email.txt for email addresses and domain.txt for domain names"
  - "Review url.txt and ip.txt for network indicators"
  - "Check telephone.txt for phone numbers relevant to the investigation"
  - "Use histogram files for frequency analysis of extracted data"
  - "Cross-reference extracted indicators with threat intelligence sources"
  - "Correlate carved data with file system metadata and timeline analysis"

field_meanings:
  offset: "Byte offset within the source image where the feature was found"
  feature: "The extracted data element (email, URL, IP, etc.)"
  context: "Surrounding bytes providing context for the extracted feature"
