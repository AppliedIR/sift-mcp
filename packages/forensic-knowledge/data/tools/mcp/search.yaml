description: "Semantic search across forensic knowledge base including Sigma rules, MITRE ATT&CK, Atomic Red Team, and analysis guidance"
platform: [any]
platform_notes: "MCP server tool. Platform depends on where the MCP server is hosted, not on the analysis target."
artifacts_parsed: []
mcp_server: forensic-rag-mcp

caveats:
  - "Search results are ranked by semantic similarity — high relevance scores (0.85+) indicate strong matches"
  - "Results depend on the quality and coverage of the indexed knowledge base"
  - "Natural language queries work best; overly technical or abbreviated queries may reduce result quality"
  - "The knowledge base is a curated subset of public forensic resources, not an exhaustive collection"
  - "Results provide GUIDANCE and REFERENCE, not definitive answers — analyst judgment is still required"
  - "MITRE technique IDs (T1003, T1059.001) can be used directly as search terms"

output_notes:
  format: structured_json
  key_fields: [title, content, source, relevance_score, technique]

advisories:
  - "Use for rapid lookup of detection logic, artifact interpretation, and investigation procedures"
  - "Sigma rules in results provide ready-to-use detection queries for SIEM platforms"
  - "Atomic Red Team results describe how attacks are executed — useful for understanding what to look for"
  - "Filter by source (sigma, mitre, atomic) to narrow results to specific knowledge types"
  - "Filter by platform (windows, linux, macos) when investigating platform-specific artifacts"
  - "Combine search results with artifact analysis for evidence-backed conclusions"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Search for detection logic related to observed attacker techniques"
  - "Look up MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs found in Hayabusa or other detection tool output"
  - "Search for Sigma rules to understand detection coverage for specific behaviors"
  - "Query Atomic Red Team entries to understand how attacks are executed and what artifacts they leave"
  - "Review all search results regardless of relevance score — lower-scored results may provide valuable context"
  - "Use search results to identify additional artifacts and tools for corroboration"
