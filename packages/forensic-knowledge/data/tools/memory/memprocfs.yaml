description: "Memory analysis framework that presents memory as a virtual filesystem for intuitive navigation"
platform: [windows, linux]
platform_notes: "Windows primary. Linux version available for analysis. Virtual filesystem approach differs from traditional Volatility-style analysis."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Virtual filesystem approach requires understanding the directory structure to find relevant data"
  - "Not all Volatility plugins have equivalents in MemProcFS"
  - "Live memory mounting provides convenience but may cause changes to the running system"
  - "Requires Dokany (Windows) or FUSE (Linux) for filesystem mounting"
  - "Analysis speed depends on image size and available RAM on the analysis system"
  - "Some advanced analysis features require commercial LeechCore plugins"

output_notes:
  format: virtual_filesystem
  key_fields: [process_list, modules, handles, network, registry]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Navigate the virtual filesystem as you would a regular file system — processes appear as directories"
  - "Process memory can be read directly as files — useful for strings extraction and YARA scanning"
  - "Supports both raw and crash dump memory formats"
  - "Can analyze live memory in read-only mode on Windows"
  - "Use alongside Volatility for cross-validation of findings"
  - "Network connections, handles, and registry data accessible through dedicated virtual directories"

quick_start: "memprocfs -device memory.raw"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Mount the memory image as a virtual file system for intuitive browsing"
  - "Navigate the process tree to identify running processes and their properties"
  - "Examine network connections through the virtual file system view"
  - "Review loaded modules and handles for each process of interest"
  - "Cross-reference findings with Volatility 3 analysis for corroboration"
  - "Use the virtual file system to extract specific artifacts for detailed analysis"
  - "Document significant findings with context from the memory analysis"
