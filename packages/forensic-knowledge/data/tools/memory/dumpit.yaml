description: "One-click Windows memory acquisition tool by Comae Technologies"
platform: [windows]
platform_notes: "Windows only. Simple acquisition tool. For Linux, use LiME."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Running on a live system changes the system — memory contents are modified during acquisition"
  - "May produce Comae proprietary format (DMP) or raw format depending on version"
  - "Requires administrator privileges"
  - "Large memory dumps (32GB+) require sufficient disk space on the destination"
  - "AV/EDR may interfere with memory acquisition"
  - "No built-in hashing — verify the output hash separately"

output_notes:
  format: raw_or_dmp
  key_fields: [image_file, image_size_bytes]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Simplest memory acquisition tool — good for deployment to non-technical responders"
  - "Verify output format compatibility with your analysis tool (Volatility, MemProcFS)"
  - "Place DumpIt on a USB drive for field deployment"
  - "Document acquisition time and system state before running"
  - "Pair with WinPmem or Belkasoft RAM Capturer as backup acquisition methods"

quick_start: "DumpIt.exe /Q"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Run DumpIt as Administrator for complete memory acquisition"
  - "Use /Q for quiet mode to avoid interactive prompts during collection"
  - "The tool creates a .dmp file and companion .txt metadata file"
  - "Document acquisition time and verify the output file size matches expected RAM"
  - "Transfer the memory dump to the analysis workstation securely"
  - "Analyze with Volatility 3 — use windows.info to verify the memory image is valid"
  - "Cross-reference memory findings with disk-based artifacts for corroboration"
