description: "Parse Windows Jump List files (automatic and custom destinations)"
platform: [windows, linux, macos]
platform_notes: ".NET tool. Runs natively as .exe on Windows. On Linux/macOS, runs via dotnet CLI. Same flags, same output. Parses Windows artifacts regardless of host OS."
artifacts_parsed: [jump_lists]

caveats:
  - "Jump Lists are per-user artifacts stored in the user's AppData directory"
  - "AutomaticDestinations track recently/frequently accessed files per application"
  - "CustomDestinations are application-defined and may contain pinned items"
  - "The AppId in the filename maps to a specific application; lookup tables are required for identification"
  - "Jump List entries persist even after the target file is deleted"
  - "Windows limits the number of entries per Jump List; older entries are evicted"

output_notes:
  format: csv
  key_fields: [SourceFile, AppId, AppIdDescription, TargetCreated, TargetModified, TargetAccessed, TargetPath, LocalPath, Arguments]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error or no data found"

advisories:
  - "Jump Lists prove a USER interacted with a file through a specific application"
  - "Entries surviving after file deletion can reveal access to files the user attempted to hide"
  - "Network paths in Jump Lists can reveal access to file shares and mapped drives"
  - "Use -d to process an entire directory; use --all to include DestList entries with no LNK data"
  - "Combine with LNK file analysis (LECmd) for corroborating evidence of file access"

quick_start: "JLECmd.exe -d \"C:/Users/*/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Recent/AutomaticDestinations\" --csv output/"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Parse Jump List files to identify per-application file access history"
  - "Review both AutomaticDestinations and CustomDestinations folders"
  - "Correlate accessed files with user activity timelines"
  - "Cross-reference with LNK files (LECmd) and ShellBags (SBECmd) for corroboration"
  - "Note the application that generated each Jump List entry for attribution context"

field_meanings:
  SourceFile: "Jump List file that contained this entry"
  SourceCreated: "Creation timestamp of the Jump List file"
  SourceModified: "Modification timestamp of the Jump List file"
  SourceAccessed: "Access timestamp of the Jump List file"
  TargetCreated: "Creation timestamp of the target file"
  TargetModified: "Modification timestamp of the target file"
  TargetAccessed: "Access timestamp of the target file"
  LocalPath: "Full local path of the accessed file"
  Arguments: "Command-line arguments used when the file was opened"
