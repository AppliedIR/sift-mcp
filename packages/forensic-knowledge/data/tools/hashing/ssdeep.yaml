description: "Context-triggered piecewise hashing (fuzzy hashing) for identifying similar files"
platform: [windows, linux, macos]
platform_notes: "Available on all platforms. Pre-installed on SIFT. Windows builds available."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Fuzzy hash similarity scores (0-100) require interpretation — low scores don't mean files are unrelated"
  - "Comparison requires matching block sizes — files of vastly different sizes cannot be meaningfully compared"
  - "Not suitable for files smaller than 4KB due to insufficient entropy"
  - "False positives occur with files that share common templates or headers"
  - "Not a replacement for cryptographic hashes (SHA256) — use both for different purposes"
  - "Similarity threshold varies by use case — 50%+ often indicates related files, but context matters"

output_notes:
  format: text
  key_fields: [fuzzy_hash, filename, match_score]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Use -r for recursive directory hashing and -m for matching against a hash database"
  - "Use -p for pretty matching output showing percentage similarity"
  - "Ideal for identifying malware variants, repackaged tools, and related document versions"
  - "Combine with YARA and cryptographic hashes for multi-layered file identification"
  - "Build a fuzzy hash database of known malware for ongoing comparison"
  - "Particularly useful for identifying slightly modified malware that evades exact hash matching"

quick_start: "ssdeep -r /evidence/mount > fuzzy_hashes.txt"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Compute fuzzy hashes for files across the evidence to enable similarity comparison"
  - "Use -d (directory mode) to compare all files against each other for similarity clustering"
  - "Use -m to match files against a set of known fuzzy hashes"
  - "Set a similarity threshold with -t to control match sensitivity (0-100, higher is stricter)"
  - "Review all matches — even moderate similarity scores may indicate related malware variants"
  - "Cross-reference similar files with traditional hash lookups and YARA scanning"
  - "Use fuzzy hash similarity to identify polymorphic or slightly modified malware copies"
