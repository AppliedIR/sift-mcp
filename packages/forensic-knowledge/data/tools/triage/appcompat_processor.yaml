description: "Cross-system ShimCache/AmCache correlation tool for identifying lateral movement and execution patterns"
platform: [windows, linux, macos]
platform_notes: "Python-based. Works on all platforms. Processes pre-parsed Amcache/ShimCache CSV files."
artifacts_parsed: [shimcache, amcache]

caveats:
  - "Correlation quality depends on input data quality — garbage in, garbage out"
  - "ShimCache (AppCompatCache) data quality varies significantly across Windows versions"
  - "Cross-system time correlation requires synchronized timestamps across source systems"
  - "Large datasets from many systems can be resource-intensive to process"
  - "False positives in correlation from common system binaries present on all systems"

output_notes:
  format: csv
  key_fields: [hostname, filename, filepath, last_modified, executed_flag, correlation_score]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Feed AppCompatCacheParser and AmcacheParser CSV output as input"
  - "Use for lateral movement detection across multiple collected systems"
  - "Focus on executables appearing on multiple systems in temporal sequence"
  - "Filter out known-good Windows binaries to reduce noise"
  - "Combine with network flow data and logon events for comprehensive lateral movement timeline"

quick_start: "AppCompatProcessor.exe -f shimcache_output.csv --csv output/"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Process ShimCache data across multiple systems for enterprise-wide analysis"
  - "Review all entries for file path anomalies and unusual binary locations"
  - "Use timeline output for temporal analysis across multiple hosts"
  - "Cross-reference results with individual AppCompatCacheParser output for per-host detail"
  - "Correlate findings with network-based indicators for lateral movement detection"
  - "Document any files appearing across multiple systems as potential indicators of spread"
