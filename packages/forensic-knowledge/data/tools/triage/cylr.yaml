description: "Open-source forensic artifact collection tool for rapid triage of Windows, Linux, and macOS systems"
platform: [windows, linux, macos]
platform_notes: ".NET-based. Works on all platforms. Collection targets are OS-specific."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Collection scope is predefined — may not include all artifacts for every investigation type"
  - "Requires administrative/root privileges for complete artifact collection"
  - "Running on a live system modifies the system (timestamps, prefetch entries, etc.)"
  - "Output is a ZIP archive — verify integrity after transfer"
  - "Does not collect volatile data (RAM, network connections) — use separate tools for those"

output_notes:
  format: zip_archive
  key_fields: [collected_files, collection_log]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Use -od to specify output directory for the collection archive"
  - "Use -of to specify output filename"
  - "Lighter and faster than KAPE — good for rapid deployment across many endpoints"
  - "Custom collection paths can be specified via JSON configuration"
  - "Pair with KAPE modules or Zimmerman tools for post-collection processing"
  - "Verify collected artifacts against expected list to ensure completeness"

quick_start: "CyLR.exe"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Run CyLR on the target system to collect standard forensic artifacts"
  - "Use -od to specify output directory for the collection archive"
  - "Use -c to specify custom artifact paths in addition to defaults"
  - "Use -d to combine custom paths with default CyLR collection list"
  - "Transfer the resulting ZIP archive to the analysis workstation"
  - "Extract and process collected artifacts with appropriate parsing tools"
  - "Document the collection scope, timestamp, and system identification"
