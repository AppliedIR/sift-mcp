name: HollowsHunter
category: malware
description: "Scan running processes for hollowed, injected, or modified code using PE-sieve engine"
platform: [windows]
platform_notes: "Windows only. Requires live system access. No Linux equivalent (use Volatility for memory-based detection on Linux)."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Live system scanning only — cannot analyze memory dumps (use Volatility for offline analysis)"
  - "May miss non-PE implants (pure shellcode, script-based implants)"
  - "Scanning may trigger AV/EDR alerts or interfere with running processes"
  - "False positives from JIT-compiled code (.NET, Java) and legitimately packed software"
  - "Dumped artifacts require further analysis — the tool identifies anomalies, not malware families"
  - "Elevated privileges required for scanning system processes"

output_notes:
  format: json_and_dumps
  key_fields: [pid, process_name, is_managed, replaced, implanted, unreachable_file, patched]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "no suspicious findings"
  1: "suspicious findings detected"

advisories:
  - "Use as a rapid triage tool to identify process injection and hollowing"
  - "Pair with Moneta for complementary detection (different detection approaches)"
  - "Review dumped PE files with YARA and CAPA for classification"
  - "The -dir flag specifies output directory for dumps and reports"
  - "Use -json for JSON output suitable for automated processing"
  - "Compare results with Volatility malfind plugin for offline corroboration"

quick_start: "hollows_hunter.exe"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Run hollows_hunter to scan all running processes for injection indicators (via wintools-mcp)"
  - "Use /pname or /pid to target specific suspicious processes"
  - "Review all detections — the tool identifies replaced PEs, shellcode injection, hooks, and in-memory patches"
  - "Use /dir to specify output directory for memory dumps of detected anomalies"
  - "Cross-reference detected process anomalies with Volatility malfind results"
  - "Submit dumped PE files to capa and YARA for behavioral and signature analysis"
  - "Correlate findings with process execution evidence from Prefetch and Amcache"
  - "Cross-MCP: Submit dumped modules for static analysis (remnux: analyze_file)"
  - "Cross-MCP: Verify flagged processes against baseline (windows-triage: check_process_tree)"
