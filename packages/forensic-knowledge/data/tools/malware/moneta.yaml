name: Moneta
category: malware
description: "Detect malicious memory modifications in running processes through memory region analysis"
platform: [windows]
platform_notes: "Windows only. Requires live system access. No Linux equivalent (use Volatility for memory analysis on Linux)."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Live system scanning only — cannot analyze memory dumps"
  - "False positives from JIT-compiled code (.NET, Java), debug builds, and legitimate packers"
  - "May trigger AV/EDR behavioral detection during scanning"
  - "Does not identify specific malware families — identifies anomalous memory regions"
  - "Requires elevated privileges for system-wide scanning"
  - "Results require analyst interpretation to distinguish malicious from benign anomalies"

output_notes:
  format: text
  key_fields: [pid, process_name, region_type, suspicion_type, address, size]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Complements Hollows Hunter with different detection methodology"
  - "Focus on private executable memory regions and modified code sections"
  - "Use --from-base to analyze specific processes by PID"
  - "Combine with process memory dumping tools for deep analysis of flagged regions"
  - "Particularly effective for detecting reflective DLL injection and manual mapping"

quick_start: "Moneta64.exe -m ioc -p 1234"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Run Moneta to scan process memory for suspicious memory regions"
  - "Use -m ioc mode for IOC-matching suspicious region detection"
  - "Use -m region to examine all suspicious memory regions for comprehensive analysis"
  - "Review all detected suspicions — the tool identifies shellcode, injection, hollowing, and reflective DLL loading"
  - "Use -d flag to dump suspicious memory regions for further analysis"
  - "Cross-reference with hollows_hunter and Volatility malfind for corroboration"
  - "Use --filter options to reduce known false positives (CLR, WoW64) in subsequent scans"
