category: malware
description: "Extract printable character sequences from binary files for initial malware triage and indicator extraction"
platform: [windows, linux, macos]
platform_notes: "GNU strings on Linux (binutils). Sysinternals strings on Windows. Flag differences: GNU uses -a (all sections), Sysinternals uses -a (ASCII only). bstrings (Zimmerman) is a .NET alternative with regex support."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Strings extraction is a passive analysis technique — it does not execute or detonate the sample"
  - "ASCII strings (-a or default) and Unicode strings (-el for UTF-16LE) should both be extracted"
  - "Packed, encrypted, or obfuscated binaries yield minimal useful strings until unpacked"
  - "Not all extracted strings are meaningful — significant manual filtering is required"
  - "Default minimum string length is 4 characters; use -n to adjust (e.g., -n 8 to reduce noise)"
  - "Strings in malware may be decoys planted to mislead analysts"

output_notes:
  format: text
  key_fields: [offset, string_value]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Extract BOTH ASCII and Unicode strings: 'strings -a file' and 'strings -el file' (or use FLOSS for automatic encoding detection)"
  - "Look for: URLs, IP addresses, file paths, registry keys, API function names, error messages, and command strings"
  - "Use grep/regex on strings output to filter for IOC patterns (IPs, domains, base64, etc.)"
  - "The -t flag shows the offset of each string, useful for correlating with disassembly"
  - "For deeper analysis, use FLOSS (FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver) which decodes obfuscated strings"
  - "Compare strings from a suspicious file against strings from a known-good version of the same binary"
  - "Windows executables with import table strings (kernel32, advapi32, ws2_32) reveal API capabilities"

quick_start: "strings -a target_file"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Extract strings from binary files to identify embedded indicators"
  - "Use -a flag to scan the entire file, not just initialized data sections"
  - "Extract both ASCII and Unicode strings (use -el for UTF-16LE on Linux)"
  - "Search extracted strings for IOCs: URLs, IP addresses, file paths, registry keys, commands"
  - "Cross-reference identified strings with threat intelligence and YARA rules"
  - "Compare strings output with capa behavioral analysis for context"
  - "Document notable strings with file offset context for the investigation record"
