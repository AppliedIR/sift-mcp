description: "Department of Defense forensic imaging tool — patched version of dd with hashing, verification, and split output"
platform: [linux]
platform_notes: "Linux/Unix only. Patched dd variant. Not available on Windows."
artifacts_parsed: []

caveats:
  - "Forensic imaging must be performed on write-blocked source media to prevent evidence alteration"
  - "Raw/dd format images are exact sector copies with no compression — image size equals source size"
  - "Network transfer during imaging adds latency; local imaging is faster and more reliable"
  - "Bad sectors are logged but may result in incomplete data at those locations"
  - "Imaging a running system (live imaging) risks capturing inconsistent data"
  - "The source device must not be mounted read-write during imaging"

output_notes:
  format: raw_image
  key_fields: [input_hash, output_hash, bytes_copied, errors]

exit_code_hints:
  0: "success with matching hashes"
  1: "error"

advisories:
  - "Always use a hardware write blocker when imaging physical media"
  - "Use hash= parameter to compute hash during imaging (e.g., hash=sha256) — this is faster than hashing after"
  - "Use hlog= to write hash values to a separate log file for documentation"
  - "Use split= to split output into manageable chunks (e.g., split=4G for DVD-sized segments)"
  - "Use log= to capture the imaging log including sector errors and progress"
  - "Verify the image after acquisition by comparing source and destination hashes"
  - "Document the imaging process: source device, write blocker used, command issued, hash values, and examiner"
  - "For E01/EWF format images, use ewfacquire instead — E01 provides compression and case metadata"

quick_start: "dc3dd if=/dev/sdX hof=image.dd hash=sha256 log=image.log"

investigation_sequence:
  - "Ensure source media is connected through a hardware write blocker"
  - "Image the source device with inline hashing for acquisition verification"
  - "Use hash= parameter for on-the-fly hash computation (md5, sha1, sha256)"
  - "Use hlog= to write hash values to a separate log file for documentation"
  - "Use log= to capture the full imaging log including any sector errors"
  - "Verify the image after acquisition by comparing source and destination hashes"
  - "Document the imaging process: source device, write blocker, command, hash values, and examiner"
