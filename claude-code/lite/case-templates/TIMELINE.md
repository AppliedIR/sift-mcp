## Format Guide

- **Timestamp:** Full UTC date and time (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ)
- **System:** Which system/host the event occurred on
- **Event:** What happened (brief description)
- **Source Artifact:** File path where this was found
- **Finding Ref:** Reference to Finding # in FINDINGS.md

Update IMMEDIATELY when timeline events are discovered. Sort chronologically.

## Timeline Discipline

- All timestamps in UTC
- Include timezone source if converting from local time
- Note timestamp precision (some artifacts only have date, not time)
- Mark estimated times with ~ prefix
- Note gaps or missing time periods
